                            blue has direct relation with quality and most of the “agile” project are failing for poor
                            quality.

                        <li>I’ve been in different companies that call them self “Agile” so working in their “Agile
                            environment” what I’ve seen is that these companies use Scrum or Scrumban ( Scrum + Kanban),
                            quite often as a religion without asking why of the things.
                        </li>
                        <li>Agile, is a “philosophy” of software production. Has to be cultural in the company.
                            You don't do Agile, you should be Agile
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They don't realize that it requires an organizational change, a change in mind-set and
                            approach, for one to become truly Agile. Partial adoption is even more dangerous than
                            non-adoption, because there is a false sense of expectation that the teams will now start to
                            deliver. An eventual failure leads to maligning the whole method and leads to a belief that
                            "Agile does not work for us."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A manager told me about pair programming:
                            2 ppl doing one thing when could have 2 ppl doing different things.
                            It is impossible that these ppl deliver the same….

                            (well u know, probably such manager still thinking that if a woman deliver
                            in 9 months, 10 women will deliver in 1 month.

                    We are uncovering better ways of developing
                    software by doing it and helping others do it.
                    Through this work we have come to value:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment highlight-red">Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
                    <li class="fragment highlight-red">Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li class="fragment highlight-red">Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
                    <li class="fragment highlight-red">Responding to change over following a plan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That is, while there is value in the items on
                    the right, we value the items on the left more.

                        </li>
                        <li>Change is a reality of software development. You need a project plan, in fact I would be
                            worried about any project that didn’t have one. But has to be flexible, has to be soft and
                            allow changes
